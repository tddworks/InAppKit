# InAppKit

> **The simplest way to add premium features to your Swift app**

Transform any SwiftUI view into a premium feature with just one line of code. InAppKit handles StoreKit complexity so you can focus on building great features.

```swift
ContentView()
    .withPurchases("com.yourapp.pro")
```
