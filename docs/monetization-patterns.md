## Pattern Overview

| Pattern | Best For | User Mental Model | InAppKit Setup |
|---------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Freemium** | Apps where users need to experience value | *"I love this app, now I want more"* | Multiple tiers |
| **Premium** | Apps with clear immediate value | *"This solves my problem right now"* | Single unlock |
| **Subscription** | Apps providing ongoing value/content | *"I use this regularly"* | Time-based features |
| **Feature Store** | Power user apps with many features | *"I'll buy what I need"* | Individual features |

## üéØ Try Before You Buy (Freemium)

**Perfect for**: Apps where users need to experience value first

### User Mental Model
*"I love this app, now I want more powerful features"*

### Implementation

```swift
enum PhotoFeature: String, AppFeature {
    case advancedFilters = "advanced_filters"
    case cloudStorage = "cloud_storage"
    case batchProcessing = "batch_processing"
    case rawSupport = "raw_support"
}

ContentView()
    .withPurchases(products: [
        Product("com.photoapp.basic", features: [PhotoFeature.advancedFilters]),
        Product("com.photoapp.pro", features: [
            PhotoFeature.advancedFilters,
            PhotoFeature.cloudStorage,
            PhotoFeature.batchProcessing
        ]),
        Product("com.photoapp.professional", features: PhotoFeature.allCases)
    ])
```

### Example: Photo Editing App

```swift
struct FiltersView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            // Free filters
            FilterRow("Basic", "Vintage", "BW")

            // Premium filters
            FilterRow("HDR", "Portrait", "Cinematic")
                .requiresPurchase(PhotoFeature.advancedFilters)
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Freemium Benefits**
- Users understand the upgrade value
- Natural conversion funnel
- Word-of-mouth growth

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Freemium Challenges**
- Must provide enough free value to hook users
- Complex feature tier management

## üíé All-or-Nothing (Premium)

**Perfect for**: Apps with clear, immediate value proposition

### User Mental Model
*"This solves my problem right now, I'll pay upfront"*

### Implementation

```swift
enum UtilityFeature: String, AppFeature {
    case fullAccess = "full_access"
}

ContentView()
    .withPurchases("com.utilityapp.pro")

// Gate everything behind purchase
MainAppView()
    .requiresPurchase()
```

### Example: Professional Tool

```swift
struct CalculatorView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Scientific Calculator Pro")

            if InAppKit.shared.hasAccess(to: "com.calculatorapp.pro") {
                AdvancedCalculatorView()
            } else {
                Text("Try 3 calculations free")
                BasicCalculatorView(limit: 3)
                    .requiresPurchase(when: calculationCount > 3)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Premium Benefits**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Higher revenue per user
- Clear value proposition

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Premium Challenges**
- Higher barrier to entry
- Must convince users before they experience value

## üìÖ Ongoing Value (Subscription)

**Perfect for**: Apps providing regular updates, content, or cloud services

### User Mental Model
*"I use this regularly and it keeps getting better"*

### Implementation

```swift
enum SubscriptionFeature: String, AppFeature {
    case premiumContent = "premium_content"
    case cloudSync = "cloud_sync"
    case prioritySupport = "priority_support"
    case earlyAccess = "early_access"
}

ContentView()
    .withPurchases(products: [
        Product("com.newsapp.monthly", features: [SubscriptionFeature.premiumContent]),
        Product("com.newsapp.annual", features: [
            SubscriptionFeature.premiumContent,
            SubscriptionFeature.cloudSync,
            SubscriptionFeature.prioritySupport
        ])
    ])
```

### Example: Content App

```swift
struct ArticleView: View {
    let article: Article

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(article.title)
            Text(article.preview)

            if article.isPremium {
                Text("Continue reading...")
                    .requiresPurchase(SubscriptionFeature.premiumContent)
            } else {
                Text(article.fullContent)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Subscription Benefits**
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Justifies ongoing development
- Higher lifetime value

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Subscription Challenges**
- Must continuously provide value
- Subscription fatigue among users

## üè™ Feature Store

**Perfect for**: Power user apps with many specialized features

### User Mental Model
*"I'll buy exactly what I need for my workflow"*

### Implementation

```swift
enum DesignFeature: String, AppFeature {
    case vectorTools = "vector_tools"
    case aiGeneration = "ai_generation"
    case teamCollaboration = "team_collaboration"
    case advancedExport = "advanced_export"
    case pluginSupport = "plugin_support"
}

ContentView()
    .withPurchases(products: [
        Product("com.designapp.vectors", features: [DesignFeature.vectorTools]),
        Product("com.designapp.ai", features: [DesignFeature.aiGeneration]),
        Product("com.designapp.team", features: [DesignFeature.teamCollaboration]),
        Product("com.designapp.export", features: [DesignFeature.advancedExport]),
        Product("com.designapp.everything", features: DesignFeature.allCases)
    ])
```

### Example: Design Tool

```swift
struct ToolbarView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            BasicTools()

            VectorToolsButton()
                .requiresPurchase(DesignFeature.vectorTools)

            AIGenerationButton()
                .requiresPurchase(DesignFeature.aiGeneration)

            ExportButton()
                .requiresPurchase(DesignFeature.advancedExport)
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Feature Store Benefits**
- Users pay only for what they use
- Flexible pricing strategy
- Can appeal to different user segments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Store Challenges**
- Complex feature management
- Can be overwhelming for casual users
